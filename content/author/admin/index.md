Quite a number of things have gone on over the last several months; most notably, we have made excellent progress with our fundraising thanks to a Covenant With the Poor appeal through the Catholic Church. Through that appeal, we have raised a further Â£6000, which brings us very much in line with our goal of Â£8000 for the health center.  
Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, it has not been possible for work on this project to begin this summer as we had at one stage hoped. However, we are now ready to begin comissioning the manufacture of doors and windows. We are confident that we will be able to ensure, when the time comes, that the building work can be done very quickly and efficiently.  
We are planning another fundraising event in late November, and will be sending out invitations in due course.
