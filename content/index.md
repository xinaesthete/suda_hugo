**WHO ARE WE?**  
We are a small charity, based in Winchester, UK. We are dedicated to improving the welfare of the rural population living in the Sumbawanga area of South Western Tanzania through fundraising activities in Britain.  
**Sumbawanga Development Action (SUDA)** is a UK registered charity – since 2005.

The idea came well before this. After visiting the villagers in Kalalasi we discovered that local people in that area need some help to improve their productivity, health and education infrastructure. So we raised some funds and did a project to help women potters improve their productivity by building a more efficient kiln. We approached ITDG, now [**Practical Action**](https://www.practicalaction.org/), who gave us plans for a better bonfire kiln.

**MISSION AND VISION:** SUDAs vision is of communities that are self reliant in a sustainable environment. While they can do most things for themselves voluntarily, they do need some help.

**OBJECTIVES:**

*   To advance education,
*   To preserve and protect good health.
*   To relieve poverty and hardship among the inhabitants of Sumbawanga.
*   To provide financial and material assistance in order to improve infrastructure.
*   To establish and maintain educational and other community facilities.

SUDA is dedicated to providing much needed funding and welfare support in order to improve the lives of children and young adults in Africa.  
Working within the Sumbawanga area, the SUDA team have concentrated their efforts on developing Health and Education infrastructure as well as planting trees to reduce the effects of climate change.  
The past four years have been extremely busy and, through financial grants, SUDA has been able to fund projects that have made a considerable difference to the lives of the local population.  
This site gives the visitor a chance to read about the work carried out by the SUDA team. It is regularly updated with news of upcoming events along with reports from visits to Tanzania. We also give information about our fundraising activities. Please spend some time reading about the work we do and those we work with, in the Sumbawanga area of Tanzania. If you would like to know more about SUDA then please feel free to contact us.

**HOW DO WE RAISE FUNDS?**

*   Performances
*   Tea parties
*   Fundraising lunches
*   Sponsored events
*   Sponsorships
*   Grants

**HOW DO WE SPEND THE MONEY WE RAISE?**  
Every penny raised through fundraising is used to help the people of Sumbawanga, Tanzania. So far, projects SUDA has used its funding for include:

*   Facilitating Kiln building
*   Health Centre
*   Water harvesting
*   Greening project (tree planting)
*   Matai and Kanyele Secondary school beds

**HOW CAN WE BE SURE THE MONEY WE RAISE IS USED CORRECTLY?**  
Normally the charity team make biannual visits to Sumbawanga to carry out a required project. In case of big projects where preliminary work has to be done, staged payments are released to local builders and carpenters once proof of work has been received. Now that there is a mobile phone network in the rural areas we can talk to lots of people and hear how projects are progressing.
