If you’re in the Winchester area and would like to meet up with us all to help raise funds for a bio gas project in Kalalasi, we’d love to see you. Please let me know on 01962 861217 or email \[kitty \*at\* sumbawanga \*dot\* org \*dot\* uk\] if you plan to attend.

It will be held at 10 Christchurch Road, Winchester SO23 9SR. Bring something for the BBQ and a donation for funds. This is a chance to see everyone before we go to Kalalasi to help out with the final stages of building the Health Centre. Mbeka’s band Waraba will be playing and there will be food and drink, African crafts for sale and a raffle.

Children welcome.

Quite a number of things have gone on over the last several months; most notably, we have made excellent progress with our fundraising thanks to a Covenant With the Poor appeal through the Catholic Church. Through that appeal, we have raised a further Â£6000, which brings us very much in line with our goal of Â£8000 for the health center.  
Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, it has not been possible for work on this project to begin this summer as we had at one stage hoped. However, we are now ready to begin comissioning the manufacture of doors and windows. We are confident that we will be able to ensure, when the time comes, that the building work can be done very quickly and efficiently.  
We are planning another fundraising event in late November, and will be sending out invitations in due course.
