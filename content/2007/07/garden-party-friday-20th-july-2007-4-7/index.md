If you’re in the Winchester area and would like to meet up with us all to help raise funds for a bio gas project in Kalalasi, we’d love to see you. Please let me know on 01962 861217 or email \[kitty \*at\* sumbawanga \*dot\* org \*dot\* uk\] if you plan to attend.

It will be held at 10 Christchurch Road, Winchester SO23 9SR. Bring something for the BBQ and a donation for funds. This is a chance to see everyone before we go to Kalalasi to help out with the final stages of building the Health Centre. Mbeka’s band Waraba will be playing and there will be food and drink, African crafts for sale and a raffle.

Children welcome.
