We raised just over Â£1000 at Westgate. It was a lively evening and the atmosphere with the African Market and variety of performers was brilliant. Many thanks to all the staff and pupils who helped out. We are really excited to have a link between Matai School and Westgate and the money will help with beds for the students there.

Meanwhile back in Kalalasi the foundations are finished for the Health Clinic, they are drying out for a few days then next week the walls will start going up. The doors and windows are on site and the district engineer has seen it and given them advice. He will continue to supervise the building.
