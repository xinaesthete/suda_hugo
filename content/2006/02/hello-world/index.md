Here is the new [wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) based website for the SUDA charity (yes, it’s official now – we are a registered charity, #1111900). This should make it easy to keep anyone who’s interested up to date on all of our activities. If you are so inclined, you can subscribe to rss newsfeeds, and be kept abreast of any changes.

I congratulate you on the charity actions you take in improving our poverty-stricken societies.Kalalasi village is my home.I am doing BA.Ed at The university of dodoma-Tanzania.

I’m very much impressed with your activities.Keep on moving.

I’m really interested with your charity activities.In addition to that I’m happy since I’m a resident of the concerned areas, i.e Kalalasi.I suggest that you may also help those residents on getting rid of their illiteracy may by giving them education and importantly helping them to love to read books,as most Europeans do,so that they can be educationally liberated.
