St Peter’s Catholic Church Winchester (Covenant with the Poor) once again helped us with funds for improving the health center. This allowed us to purchase lab equipment: particularly a microscope and a hemoglobin tester. This allows the center to diagnose common health problems such as malaria, water born diseases and chest infections much more effectively, which can obviously be quite critical in many situations.

The government have provided solar power, a fridge and a freezer. This enables storage of medication for use as it is needed, saving the need to travel to Sumbawanga in order to collect it when it might be urgent. They have also provided two lab technicians.
