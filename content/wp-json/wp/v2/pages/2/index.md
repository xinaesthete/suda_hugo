**WHO ARE WE?<\\/strong>  
\\nWe are a small charity, based in Winchester, UK. We are dedicated to improving the welfare of the rural population living in the Sumbawanga area of South Western Tanzania through fundraising activities in Britain.  
\\n**Sumbawanga Development Action (SUDA)<\\/strong> is a UK registered charity – since 2005.<\\/p>\\n****

****The idea came well before this. After visiting the villagers in Kalalasi we discovered that local people in that area need some help to improve their productivity, health and education infrastructure. So we raised some funds and did a project to help women potters improve their productivity by building a more efficient kiln. We approached ITDG, now [**Practical Action<\\/strong><\\/a>, who gave us plans for a better bonfire kiln.<\\/p>\\n**](\"https:\/\/www.practicalaction.org\/\")****

****[****MISSION AND VISION:<\\/strong> SUDAs vision is of communities that are self reliant in a sustainable environment. While they can do most things for themselves voluntarily, they do need some help.<\\/p>\\n****](\"https:\/\/www.practicalaction.org\/\")****

            **HOW CAN WE BE SURE THE MONEY WE RAISE IS USED CORRECTLY?<\\/strong>  
            \\nNormally the charity team make biannual visits to Sumbawanga to carry out a required project. In case of big projects where preliminary work has to be done, staged payments are released to local builders and carpenters once proof of work has been received. Now that there is a mobile phone network in the rural areas we can talk to lots of people and hear how projects are progressing.<\\/p>\\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"**
