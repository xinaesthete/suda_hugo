Mid March saw the opening of the Health Centre. Mr. Kauzeni the ward councillor officiated as the M.P. Mr. Mwananzila couldn’t make it. There was a great gathering. It is up and running with just a handful of things that need finishing off. When the guttering is attached to the fascia board and pipes run into the water tanks, they will be water harvesting. The ceiling boards in the veranda waiting area will be painted white.<\\/p>\\n

The drop toilets are constructed away from the pit, so they won’t be too smelly. All in all the health care provision for Kalalasi and the surrounding villages shall be greatly improved.<\\/p>\\n

The sign at the front thanks SUDA and St. Peter’s Church in Winchester for their contribution.<\\/p>\\n
